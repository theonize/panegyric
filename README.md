# Panegyric
`How to write your own eulogy`

The word `panegyric` etymology is something like: all assembled.

What will people say about you when you're gone?
To what extent can you prophetize your future?


## Eulogium

To a large extent people treat us the way we expect to be treated.
How we expect to be treated is not necessarily how we want to be treated.
Prejudices about us are partly formed by the malleable things about us that we change.
Clothing and hairstyle are easy;  speech patterns and body language are more difficult;  all intact how we are treated.


## Pathway

It is perfectly reasonable to try to affect our destiny.
Naturally there are things out of our control.
However, there are likely more things under our control than we presume.

The path begins with the assumption that you are valuable- we take that as fact.
The path ends, in this case, at our death scene.
That corpse is more vacant of life that changed the world around it.
What are those changes?

Determine what kind of person you will be are the end.
Then, find exemplars who have those attributes.
Then, discover how they got to that point.
You cannot aimulate another's life butt you can emulate all, or part, of it.
